I applied (and was accepted into) game development studies at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola, but\r\nafter spending a year or so there I struggled, both with the studies themselves and living so far aways from home without\r\nthe social support I've built in my childhood region.\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to return to my home and study Computer Science at Uppsala University, and after about 4 years of studies there I finished about 90%\r\nof my course points, and started applying for work. \r\n\r\n## Work\r\n\r\n## Interests\r\nSince the pandemic started I've been trying to focus on working out more, along with my more seditary hobbies, \r\nsuch as reading, movies, series, cooking and rarely outside of work coding. I sadly am not very talented when it comes\r\nto artistic expression, but I sometimes get an urge to try something so I occationaly dabble in piano playing, drawing and photography.\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Header = styled.div`\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    margin: 0 auto;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst AvatarImg = styled.img`\r\n    border: 2px solid ${({theme}:any) => theme.colors.breadtext };\r\n    border-radius: 5%;\r\n    width: 200px;\r\n    height: 200px;\r\n    float: right;\r\n    margin-left: 25px;\r\n    margin-bottom: 25px;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst AboutPage = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Layout>\r\n            <title>Johan Hägg - Software Developer - About me</title>\r\n            <Header>\r\n                <AvatarImg src={`/about_avatar.jpg`} />\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <ReactMarkdown children={markdown} />\r\n        </Layout>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage\r\n"],"names":["Header","AvatarImg","theme","colors","breadtext","src","children"],"sourceRoot":""}
